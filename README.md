## 💡 Tips for Better Prompts

### Be Specific
The more details you provide, the better the AI can understand your needs. Instead of "write an article," try "write a 500-word article about sustainable living for a lifestyle blog audience."

### Provide Context
Background information helps tailor the response. Include relevant details about your industry, audience, skill level, or project constraints.

### Define the Output Format
Specify how you want results structured:
- Bullet points vs. paragraphs
- Step-by-step guide vs. summary
- Code with comments vs. pseudocode
- Essay format vs. Q&A

### Use Examples
Show the AI what good looks like. Provide examples of desired output style, format, or quality.

### Set Clear Constraints
Mention limitations:
- Word/character count
- Technical complexity level
- Things to include or avoid
- Time period or scope

### Iterate and Refine
Don't hesitate to regenerate with adjusted parameters. Prompt engineering is iterative!
